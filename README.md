# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 


### Project Files

* `run_analysis.R`  ---  R script that creates a tidy dataset titled `tidydata.txt` from the source data listed at the bottom of this README.

* `codebook.md`  ---  code book for `run_analysis.R`

* `tidydata.txt`  ---  tidy dataset generated by `run_analysis.R`

### Project Objective

The goal of this project was to create an R script titled `run_analysis.R` that performs the following operations on the source data:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Source Data Information

The data for this project was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. See the link below for a full description of the data.
